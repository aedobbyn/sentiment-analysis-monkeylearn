## Analysis

We've got data! ðŸŽ‰ Let's take a look at it. 


```r
dat %>%
  slice(1:20)
```

```

Since there are multiple rows per review, we'll want a unique identifier for each review. Each `page_num, review_num` combination represents a unique review. We could hash these two values but since we have the benefit of knowing that the reviews happen in chronological order, it seems better to number them, starting with 1 for our oldest review.

For good measure I also created a `doc_identifier` by smushing together the page and review number.


```r
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(
    doc_identifier = str_c("r", review_num, "p", page_num, sep = "_")
  )

uuids <- dat %>%
  arrange(page_num, review_num) %>%
  nest(-doc_identifier) %>%
  mutate(doc_uuid = nrow(.) - row_number() + 1) %>%
  select(-data)

dat <- dat %>%
  left_join(uuids)
```


There are only three possible sentiments for an opinion unit to have,


```r
dat$sentiment %>% factor() %>% levels()
```

```
## [1] "Negative" "Neutral"  "Positive"
```

so we can assign a number to each type of sentiment in order to be able to represent them on an ordinal scale. 



```r
dat <- dat %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    sentiment_num = switch(sentiment,
      "Negative" = -1,
      "Neutral" = 0,
      "Positive" = 1
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```



What about categories?


```r
dat$category %>% factor() %>% levels()
```

```
##  [1] "Attachments-Sharing"             "Calls"                          
##  [3] "Channels"                        "Customer Support"               
##  [5] "Desktop"                         "Ease of Use"                    
##  [7] "Emojis"                          "Feedback-Recommendation"        
##  [9] "General"                         "Groups"                         
## [11] "Integrations"                    "Messages"                       
## [13] "Mobile"                          "None"                           
## [15] "Notifications"                   "Other"                          
## [17] "Performance-Quality-Reliability" "Pricing"                        
## [19] "Purpose"                         "Search"                         
## [21] "UI-UX"                           "Web"
```

We can see there are some opinion units labeled with the category "None". It's tough to know how to interpret these, so we can filter out these rows in a new `dat_clean` dataframe. We'll also filter out low-probability sentiments and categories -- anything that the classifier is less than 55% sure is classified correctly.


```r
probability_cutoff <- 0.55

dat_clean <-
  dat %>%
  filter(!is.na(probability_unit) & !is.na(probability_unit) &
    category != "None" &
    probability_sentiment > probability_cutoff & probability_unit > probability_cutoff)
```

After cleaning, we've got 2314 unique opinion units to work with, each with a single sentiment and multiple classifications.


**Initial exploring**

Now let's get the lay of the land by seeing what the breakdown of sentiments is overall.


```r
sentiment_breakdown <-
  dat_clean %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  count() %>%
  rename(by_sentiment = n) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    total = sum(by_sentiment),
    sentiment_prop = by_sentiment / total
  )
```


![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->


We can see there are very few reviews that have a Neutral sentiment, which is useful for us. It's easier to draw conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of a product when most of the feedback is either definitively positive or negative. (That could also be a reflection of the tendency of reviewers to feel more strongly about the product they're reviewing than the general user base. But whether or not these reviews are an unbiased reflection of most users' true feelings about the product is neither here nor there ðŸ˜†.)


What is the interaction between the two main things of interest here, category and sentiment? Let's get a summary of the mean sentiment (based off of our numerical representation of sentiment) for opinion units that have been classified into each category.



```r
sentiment_by_category <-
  dat_clean %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sentiment = mean(sentiment_num)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_sentiment))
```

Performance-Quality-Reliability gets the lowest average sentiment, whereas General gets the highest.

Next I want to split these mean sentiment ratings into three equal parts and assign those parts valences that describe the mean sentiment for that category. We'll find the tertiles (a word I thought I made up but turns out it's a thing) of the mean sentiments so we can divid them three groups as they relate to each other.


```r
tertiles <- c(
    sentiment_by_category$mean_sentiment %>% quantile(1/3),
    sentiment_by_category$mean_sentiment %>% quantile(2/3)
    )

sentiment_by_category_summary <-
  tibble(name = names(tertiles), 
         value = tertiles) 

sentiment_by_category_summary %>% 
  kable()
```

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> name </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> value </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 33.33333% </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.2512253 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 66.66667% </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.7757711 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We'll use these tertiles as the bounds for assigning valences.


```r
bad_sentiment_upper_bound <- 
  sentiment_by_category_summary %>% 
  filter(name == sentiment_by_category_summary$name[1]) %>% pull(value)
good_sentiment_lower_bound <- 
  sentiment_by_category_summary %>% 
  filter(name == sentiment_by_category_summary$name[2]) %>% pull(value)

sentiment_by_category <-
  sentiment_by_category %>% 
  mutate(
    sentiment_valence = case_when(
      mean_sentiment < bad_sentiment_upper_bound ~ "Bad",
      mean_sentiment >= bad_sentiment_upper_bound & 
        mean_sentiment <= good_sentiment_lower_bound ~ "Meh",
      mean_sentiment > good_sentiment_lower_bound ~ "Good"
    ) %>% factor()
  )

sentiment_by_category %>%
  kable()
```

```r
sentiment_valence_order <- c("Good", "Meh", "Bad")

sentiment_by_category$sentiment_valence <-
  sentiment_by_category$sentiment_valence %>% fct_relevel(sentiment_valence_order)
```

And now we can colo(u)r the bars of our plot with those valences. This will be useful when we shake up the order of the categories by arranging them by different variables.

![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot is useful, but it doesn't tell us anything about how often people complain about the aspects of the product that tend to get low sentiment ratings. We might ask, are the categories that often have a negative sentiment categories that people tend to mention often in their reviews, or are they less frequent?

Let's see the frequency with which opinion units are categorized into different topics.


```r
category_freq <-
  dat_clean %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  count(sort = TRUE) %>%
  rename(
    n_opinion_units = n
  ) %>% 
  left_join(sentiment_by_category) 
```

![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->


Now we can weight the category sentiment by the number of times it occurs in an opinion unit.


```r
sentiment_by_category_weighted <-
  category_freq %>%
  mutate(
    weighted_sentiment = mean_sentiment * n_opinion_units
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(weighted_sentiment))

sentiment_by_category_weighted %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

**Overall ratings**

What about overall ratings of the product? How do those line up with sentiments assigned to each opinion unit by MonkeyLearn?


```r
ratings_by_sentiment <-
  dat_clean %>%
  distinct(doc_uuid, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(rating_perc %>% as.numeric(), na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ratings_by_sentiment %>% 
  kable()
```

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> sentiment </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> mean_rating </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Negative </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9305263 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neutral </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9600000 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Positive </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9380255 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

There is very little difference in overall ratings of the product. (It's important to remember that there is a one:many relationship between ratings and opinion units here; each review gets a at most single rating, but reviews are later parceled into multiple opinions.)

This indicates that despite critiques and a good chunk of negative opinion units, most overall reviews remain positive.






**Sub-Ratings**

We can dig into the explicit ratings of different aspects of the platform and compare them to categories assigned by MonkeyLearn.

First we have to unnest our subratings which until now we've calmly shunted along in their own list column.



We'll want to parse these "4/5", "5/5", etc. strings into numbers we can work with, in the same way we did the overall ratings.


```r
parsed_subratings <-
  reviews_with_subratings_unnested %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    subrating_num =
      ifelse(is.na(sub_rating_rating), NA,
        parse(text = sub_rating_rating) %>% eval()
      )
  )
```

What are the overall mean ratings of each aspect of the platform?


```r
parsed_subratings_summary <-
  parsed_subratings %>%
  drop_na(subrating_num, sub_rating_category) %>%
  group_by(sub_rating_category) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_subrating = mean(subrating_num)
  )

parsed_subratings_summary %>%
  dobtools::cap_df() %>%
  kable()
```

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> Sub Rating Category </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> Mean Subrating </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Customer Support </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.8882126 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ease of Use </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9280695 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Features &amp; Functionality </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9125914 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Value for Money </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.9064195 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>



How do these sub-ratings match up with category ratings we calculated earlier? Some of the subrating names match perfectly with MonkeyLearn categories like "Customer Support" and "Ease of Use", but the other two we'll need to assign an alias to be able to join it up with the mean MonkeyLearn sentiment for that category and compare the two.


```r
parsed_subratings_summary$alias <- c("Customer Support", "Ease of Use", "General", "Pricing")

parsed_subratings_summary %>%
  left_join(sentiment_by_category,
    by = c("alias" = "category")
  )
```

```

### Down to the word level

Now that we have classifications for each opinion units, we can see how the individual words in opinion units map to the sentiment and category classification they were assigned, and maybe gain some more granular insight about what people like and dislike about the product.

The [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) package is fantastic for this purpose. We'll use its `unnest_tokens` function to get a long dataframe of all words and then clean them up a bit by filtering out `stop_words` (a dataset included in the package) like "and" and "the". My helper [`dobtools::find_nums()`](https://github.com/aedobbyn/dobtools/blob/master/R/find_nums.R) mutates on a couple columns: one for whether the word in question is a number (i.e. can be converted to type numeric) and one for whether the word contains a number. If `is_num` is TRUE, then `contains_num` is also always TRUE.


```r
dat_tokenized <-
  dat_clean %>%
  nest(-content, -doc_uuid) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, content) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, "word") %>%
  dobtools::find_nums() %>%
  filter(contains_num == FALSE)
```

The `tidytext` package also includes a `sentiments` dataset which we can join on our words to get a classification of the words' sentiment in three different lexicons as well as its score on a scale of -5 (negative) to 5 (positive). (`?tidytext::sentiments` for a full explanation of the dataset.) For example:


```r
sentiments %>% filter(word == "yucky")
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
##   word  sentiment lexicon score
##   <chr> <chr>     <chr>   <int>
## 1 yucky <NA>      AFINN      -2
```

and 


```r
sentiments %>% filter(word == "yummy")
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
##   word  sentiment lexicon score
##   <chr> <chr>     <chr>   <int>
## 1 yummy <NA>      AFINN       3
```

(Don't ask me why yummy is more positive than yucky is negative ðŸ˜†.) Anyway, let's join this on our data set by "word".



```r
dat_tokenized <-
  dat_tokenized %>%
  select(-is_num, -contains_num) %>%
  left_join(tidytext::sentiments %>%
    rename(
      word_sentiment = sentiment,
      score_sentiment = score
    ),
  by = "word"
  )
```



If we're interested in doing an analysis of words that belong to opinion units that were tagged with certain categories or sentiments, we're going to need back our measure of each of those, which were labeled at the opinion unit level. Luckily we can unnest our `dat_tokenized_tfidf` dataframe in place of doing any joining.


```r
dat_tokenized_unnested <-
  dat_tokenized %>%
  unnest()
```



Do the words that make up an opinion unit have a significant effect on the sentiment it's assigned by MonkeyLearn?


```r
lm(
  data = dat_tokenized_unnested %>% drop_na(sentiment_num, score_sentiment),
  sentiment_num ~ score_sentiment
) %>%
  summary() %>%
  tidy() %>% 
  kable()
```

Yes -- words with more positive sentiments tend to occur in more positive opinion units.


As a control, we can check whether words that appear at the beginning of the alphabet tend to get higher sentiment scores. (I don't know of a reason to suspect this might be the case which is why I'm treating it as a control but maybe there is a psycholinguist out there who can set me straight?)

We'll extract just the first letter of the word and assign it the number of the alphabet from 1 to 24.


```r
assign_number <- function(l) {
  if (length(l) == 0 || !l %in% letters) {
    n <- NA_integer_
  } else {
    n <- which(letters == l)
  }
  n
}

try_assign_number <- possibly(assign_number, otherwise = NA_integer_)
```



```r
dat_tokenized_first_letter <-
  dat_tokenized %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    first_letter = substr(word, 1, 1),
    first_letter_num = try_assign_number(first_letter)
  )
```

And then plot the word's sentiment as scored on the `AFINN` scale. The dashed horizontal line represents the mean sentiment score for words in our data set.

What about the statistical relationship?


```r
lm(
  data = dat_tokenized_first_letter %>% drop_na(first_letter_num, score_sentiment),
  first_letter_num ~ score_sentiment
) %>%
  summary() %>%
  tidy() %>%

Not significant, as we might expect.

We might be interested in phrases that follow specific words like "use" or "don't use". Here we ask for everything after `word` and up until the first period.

We might also want to pull out a category or categories if they exist in the phrase. To that end we'll make a regex for all of the categories MonkeyLearn has identified (except Other which seems uninteresting):
 

```r
category_reg <-
  dat_clean$category[-which(dat_clean$category == "Other")] %>%
  tolower() %>%
  unique() %>%
  str_c(collapse = "|")
```


We can make something reusable like:


```r
search_for <- function(df = dat_clean, col = content, word = "love", append_the = FALSE) {
  word_capped <-
    dobtools::simple_cap(word)

  q_col <- enquo(col)

  look_for <- ifelse(append_the == TRUE,
    glue("{word} the |{word_capped} the "),
    glue("{word} |{word_capped} ")
  )

  out <-
    df %>%
    filter(
      str_detect(!!q_col, look_for)
    ) %>%
    distinct(!!q_col) %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(
      phrase = str_extract(!!q_col, glue("(?<={look_for}).+$")) %>%
        str_replace_all("(?<=\\.).*", ""),
      phrase_categories = str_extract_all(phrase, category_reg) %>%
        replace_y() %>%
        as_vector() %>%
        unique() %>%
        str_c(collapse = ", ")
    )

  return(out)
}
```


We can ask for our word always followed by a "the" so that we know our `phrase` will start with a noun that our `word` is referring to.


```r
search_for(word = "love", append_the = TRUE) %>%
  dobtools::replace_na_df() %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()

By default we won't append "the" after `word`. We can filter to just opinion units that contain our word and then the name of one of our categories following it.

#### TF-IDF

[Term frequency inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a measure of how often a word appears in a given document (here, a review) as opposed to overall, in all of the documents. That can give us a sense of how important it is to a given document as compared to a baseline of all words used in the entire corpus.

What we can learn from TF-IDF is, for instance, what words do people often use in reviews when they're talking about a specific aspect of the product that they tend to use less frequently when talking about other aspects of the product?
 
 To get every word's TF-IDF, we need to get within-document counts of each word. We'll also count how often the word is used in all reviews.

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dat_tokenized_counts <-  -->
<!--  dat_tokenized %>%  -->
<!--  add_count(word) %>%  -->
<!--  rename( -->
<!--    n_words_total = n -->
<!--  ) %>%  -->
<!--  group_by(doc_uuid) %>%  -->
<!--  add_count(word) %>%  -->
<!--  rename( -->
<!--    n_words_this_doc = n -->
<!--  )  %>%  -->
<!--  ungroup()  -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- Now we can ask `tidytext` to do a mutate and attach the `tf_idf` of each word to our dataframe. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dat_tokenized_tfidf <-  -->
<!--  dat_tokenized_counts %>%  -->
<!--  bind_tf_idf(word, doc_uuid, n_words_this_doc) -->
<!-- ``` -->

A question we might be interested in is: which words are most distinctive to opinion units tagged with each category? For this purpose we can treat each category as its own document (rather than each review as its own document).

We count up the number of words used in each category and then ask `tidytext` to do a mutate and attach the `tf_idf` of each word to our dataframe.


```r
category_tfidf <-
  dat_tokenized_unnested %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  add_count(word) %>%
  rename(
    n_words_this_category = n
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, category, n_words_this_category) %>%
  select(word, category, tf_idf, opinion_unit, sentiment)
```


What are the words in each category that have the maximum TF-IDF?


```r
category_tfidf_maxes <-
  category_tfidf %>%
  unnest() %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  filter(tf_idf == max(tf_idf)) %>%
  select(word, sentiment, category, tf_idf) %>%
  distinct(word, category, tf_idf) %>%
  arrange(category, word)

category_tfidf_maxes %>%
  dobtools::cap_df() %>%
  kable()

#### Going Negative

Let's focus on the places where Slack might want to improve. Pricing is more self-explanatory, so I'll focus on Performance-Quality-Reliability and Notifications.



```r
problem_categories <-
  dat_clean %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Performance-Quality-Reliability", "Notifications") &
    sentiment == "Negative")
```



```r
pqr_complaints <-
  problem_categories %>%
  mutate(review_num = row_number()) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, content) %>%
  filter(category == "Performance-Quality-Reliability") %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

Is the desktop app or mobile app mentioned more in P-Q-R complaints?
 

```r
pqr_complaints %>%
  filter(word %in% c("desktop", "mobile"))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   word        n
##   <chr>   <int>
## 1 mobile     59
## 2 desktop    43
```


How does that compare to the base rate of the mentions of desktop and mobile?


```r
dat_tokenized %>%
  filter(word %in% c("desktop", "mobile")) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  count()
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
## # Groups:   word [2]
##   word        n
##   <chr>   <int>
## 1 desktop   231
## 2 mobile    345
```

So interestingly, even though mobile is mentioned more often than desktop in reviews, most of the P-Q-R complaints seem to be about the desktop app. 


This is an area where companies can compare their own metrics to the same data scraped from reviews of other companies and trained using the same or very similar modules.


## Wrap-Up

Here we've built a relatively straightforward pipeline for an analysis of web data. We grab and clean our raw data, feed it to MonkeyLearn for extraction and classification, and then analyze the results. MonkeyLearn allows us to abstract out the machine learning and plug into a simple and reliable API. 

Thanks and happy coding!

[^2]: What I mean by that is: this particular topic classifier has a tree-like structure where each leaf belong to a single parent. MonkeyLearn first classifies each text into a top-level supercategory, one of: App-Software, Service, or Other. Once a text is classified at this first level, it then gets classified into one or more children in that supercategory. For instance, the children of App-Software are: Characteristics, Devices-Web, and Features. Finally, each of these has its own children. Take Characteristics: its children, which are leaf categories or terminal nodes for the classifier are Ease of Use, Integrations, Performance-Quality-Reliability, and UI-UX. This means that if a text doesn't appear to reference App-Software, the grandparent of UI-UX, it won't have a chance of being classified as UI-UX. This scheme of course doesn't preclude a text from being classified under multiple terminal nodes.
